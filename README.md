## 🧠 Business Intelligence Summary
Lumina AI is an executive-grade FinOps intelligence platform designed to bridge the gap between technical cloud utilization and CFO-level capital allocation. The system transforms raw telemetry from **10,000+ compute nodes** into decision-ready financial signals.

### 🎯 The Problem
Organizations operating at scale face "Technical Debt" in the form of financial leakage. Idle or underutilized instances consume capital without delivering ROI, and these costs are often hidden behind technical metrics that lack financial context.

### 💡 The Solution
The platform applies deterministic financial logic and regional benchmarking across **London, Cape Town, and New York** to surface immediate cost optimization opportunities.

## ⚙️ Audit Logic & Classification
Every infrastructure node is evaluated using specific financial rules:

* **🔴 CRITICAL: SHUTDOWN** (CPU < 5% + High Hourly Cost) → Immediate financial leakage identified.
* **🟡 MAINTAIN** (Moderate utilization) → Acceptable performance; monitor for trends.
* **🟢 OPTIMAL** (Efficient utilization) → Optimal capital deployment.

*Note: The logic includes a context-awareness layer to distinguish between genuine waste and critical high-availability (failover) nodes.*

## 🛠️ Technology & Methodology
* **FinOps Lifecycle:** Aligned with the *Inform → Optimize → Operate* framework.
* **Excel (Power Pivot):** High-performance financial modeling and analytics engine.
* **Regional Benchmarking:** Comparative cost analysis across global cloud regions.
* **ZAR-Localized Modeling:** Finance-led cloud economics focused on South African market context.
